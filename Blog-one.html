            <h2>How A Creative <span>UI</span> On Your <span>Website</span> Can Do Wonders For Your <span>Business!</span></h2>
            <p>A creative user interface can completely change the way your business website looks and performs. Before diving into why an inventive user interface is important, let us understand what UI means. In simple words, the user interface is a space where interactions between machines and humans occur. It is a feature in a device that allows a user to interact with it.
<br> <br>
                Humans are thriving in the digital age. Did you know that globally more than 4 billion people use the internet? Out of which around 1.94 bn websites are in use with over 4 million hybrid mobile apps available for download. Have you ever wondered who is responsible for the demand surge, visual effects, and interactive elements for all of these websites and apps? Who makes sure that the websites and apps look great, are accessible, inclusive, and intuitive? <a href="#">It is the UI designers</a>.</p>
          <h2>Welcome To An Amazing Experience- The Advent Of UI Design.</h2>
          <p>The digital interface came into prominence in the 1980s and soon became popular as one of the most enjoyable, user-friendly experiences of the digital world. UI is all about interaction and is not limited to just buttons and menus or appearance but it’s more about how it works. A user interface prompts a visitor to seek additional information, navigate the site, make registration or purchase decisions through dialogue or a series of clicks. It plays a pivotal role in increasing conversion rates as well as customer advocacy.</p>


<blockquote>As Jef Raskin candidly quoted, “As far as the customer is concerned, the interface is the product”.</blockquote>

<h2>Why Is The Role Of UI So Important?</h2>
<p>Good UI is crucial to good UX. It’s just not about making things appear nice but it’s about how the human mind works creatively and intuitively around the product. The user sees and interacts with the user interface, not the underlying back-end architecture of your application.</p>

<p>Simply put, a good UI is important because it has the potential to convert visitors into buyers as it facilitates interactions between the user and your website or web application. It also maximizes the responsiveness, efficiency, and accessibility of a website. It is designed to create a smooth and seamless experience.</p>

<h2>UI And UX - Same Or Different?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.websolutions.com/blog/ux-vs-ui-whats-the-difference-in-web-design/">While UI and UX designers work closely together, the two are quite different from each other in terms of the design process</a></p>
<p>UI design begins with the technical requirements of an interface. UX design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability and accessibility of a product, webpage, or app.
<br> <br>
    Repeated elements of the design create consistency and a positive UX. Businesses consider ROI when spending money to develop user interfaces (UI, UX) for websites, software, games, and devices.
    <br> <br>
    The early 2000’s also known as the Smartphone era made things challenging for Computer UI designers. This huge shift in computing hardware led to designers having to rethink interfaces from scratch. A poor UI and UX ruins the efforts. Hence, it is important to develop, user-friendly, UI, UX experience for its dedicated end-users.</p>
